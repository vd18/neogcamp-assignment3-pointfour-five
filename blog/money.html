            <p class="peragraph">When a whole country tries to get richer by printing more money, it rarely works.
                Because if everyone has more money, prices go up instead. And people find they need more and more money
                to buy the same amount of goods</p>

            <p class="peragraph"> To get richer, a country has to make and sell more things – whether goods or services.
                This makes it
                safe to print more money, so that people can buy those extra things. In this case, printing more money
                lets people spend more, which lets companies produce more, but if everyone have money to buy product at
                some time there will be sortage of product and as product demand goes high that product price also go
                high. this will create Hyperinflation.
            </p>
            <p class="peragraph">
                In a period of hyperinflation, investors will try and buy a stable foreign currency because that will
                hold its value much better. Hyperinflation in effect destroys purchasing power and encourages hoarding
                of goods, as people and businesses anticipate further price increases. Periods of hyperinflation tend
                therefore to be self perpetuating, as shortages further drive up prices.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h3p">There are two famous example when goverment tries to print more money and it didn't go well
            </h2>
            <h3 class="h3p">Germany</h3>
            <p class="peragraph">
                Inflation was so bad in Germany that money became worthless. Here a child is using money as a toy. Money
                was used as wallpaper and to make kites. Towards the end of 1923, so much money was needed, people had
                to carry it about in wheelbarrows. You hear stories of people stealing the wheelbarrow, but leaving the
                money.

                Printing more money is exactly what Weimar Germany did in 1922. To meet Allied reparations, they printed
                more money; this caused the hyperinflation of the 1920s. The hyperinflation led to the collapse of the
                economy.

            </p>

            <h3 class="h3p">Zimbabwe</h3>
            <p class="peragraph">
                In 2008, Zimbabwe had the second highest incidence of hyperinflation on record. The estimated inflation
                rate for Nov 2008 was 79,600,000,000%.
                Zimbabwe had the worst of both worlds – prices rising faster than wages and incomes. People became
                “poverty billionaires’ It was no good having a salary of One billion dollars if a loaf of bread cost two
                billion. Anyone with savings lost everything – unless they were able to exchange with foreign currency.
                Even people with assets and property often saw the value shrink. Foreign exchange controls make it very
                hard to take money out of the country.

            </p>

            <h3 class="h3p">In very simple terms</h3>
            <p class="peragraph pera-foot">
                if there is a two monkeys, one have 10 bananas and other one have 3 bananas, so one is rich and one is
                poor. if someone gave 7 bananas to the poor monkeys there is no different and banana as lost its values
