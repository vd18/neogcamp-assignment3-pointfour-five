            <p class="peragraph">there are some people who can understand english but they cant talk in english with
                daily basic, to solve this problem we have vary easy solution movies and webseries. yes One years
                ago i have same problem ,how much i learn grammer and rules of enlish, i could not speak english on
                daily basis and conversation but than i started watching series and movies, at first it was diffcult i
                cant understand whats going on cause of lack of vocabulary and i cant catch up with subtitle speed.
                after giving some time it became little easy understand </p>

            <p class="peragraph">after some months you are going to understand and every time you want to speak you dont
                have to remember all the rules and another advantages of this is now when you read or write wrong
                sentence you wil feel like something is wrong and even sometime you dont even know what.</p>


            <p class="peragraph">Today we can watch any series and movies through any ott platform like netflix, amezon
                prime, disney+ and hbomax etc. <span class="telegram"> or you can download any series using telegram and torent etc. if you know how to download </span></p>



            <h3 class="h3p">Things to keep in mind</h3>

            <ol>
                <li> Choose shows with shorter episodes so that you don’t get too overwhelmed with all the new
                    vocabulary.</li>
                <li>Watch the TV shows with English subtitles NOT subtitles in your own language. Reading and listening
                    to English at the same time is the best way to get your brain to absorb new vocabulary.</li>
                <li>Try not to pause and look up words you don’t understand, as this will stop you from enjoying the
                    plot.
                    Instead, try and work out the word’s meaning from the show’s context. </li>

            </ol>
