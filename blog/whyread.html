            <p class="peragraph">Charles Bukowski has been called an alcoholic, a narcissist, and a misogynist; but i
                dont think is care about what people call him. He is not the type who enamore with fancy words and high
                ideals Instead, he writes about harsh reality. While he uses his words in a very simple manner, they
                still manage to make a place in the reader’s heart</p>

            <p class="peragraph"> He writes about his real-life experiance and with that he also tell us about harsh
                reality that had been going on with him. he expose his ture toughts, emotion and how he felt in that
                situation throuh his books and poems. charles bukowski was brutally honest. in his first novel which was
                autobiography he talks about how he hated to go outside of the house, how his father often beat him to
                death.
                how much he hated most of all things that happan to him in his childhood and how he felt so powerless.
            </p>
            <p class="peragraph">
                And other three books he talk about his life as teen, youth and his life after he get famous. his life
                was not full of drama, hustle, despair, happy,good,sad it was quite boring but how he write about it
                with his true
                thought and reality he makes his mark in readers heart

            <h2 class="h3p">Some of my favorite quotes of charles bukowski
            </h2>
            
            <h4 class="h3p">" I had no interests. I had no interest in anything. I had no idea how I was going to
                escape. At least the others had some taste for life. They seemed to understand something that I didn’t
                understand. Maybe I was lacking. It was possible. I often felt inferior. I just wanted to get away from
                them. But there was no place to go.."</h4>

                <h4 class="h3p">“The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts, while the stupid ones are  full of confidence.”</h4>
           

            <h4 class="h3p">" I don't hate people. I just feel better when they aren't around."</h4>

            <h4 class="h3p">“Find what you love and let it kill you.”</h4>
